function [Sys] = SymbolicSolver(Sys)
    % SymbolicSolver creates a symbolic representation of a nonlinear graph
    % model. This function relies on the property that the algebraic state
    % equations are linear w.r.t. the algebraic states.

    % Note, the output vector is just the state vector [x_d; x_a] expressed
    % in terms of dyanmic states, external states, inputs, and external
