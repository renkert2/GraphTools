function [Coeff,TypeSys] = MakeCoeffMatrix (All,TypeAll,numType)
    % MakeCoeffMatrix is a function develops coefficient matrices for the
    % component graphs. Information stored in as Type and Value is
    % converted to matrices that are used the system generation code
    
    %%% INPUTS
    % Comp - Cell Array of Comp_Graph classes
    % ic - vector map of unique types to all types. This is the output of 
    %      the UniqueString function
    % indicator - String prefix for the type and coefficient matrix 'C' and
    %             'P' are currently supported
    % type - cell array of types
    % val - cell array of values

    %%% OUTPUTS
    % Comp - Cell array of Comp_Graph classes with updated coefficient
    % matrices
