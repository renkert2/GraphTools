classdef GraphInput < handle
    % GraphInput is a class that describes an input in the Graph Model
    % Toolbox. GraphInputs can be instatiated as an empty object, input
    % parsing, or as:
    % 
    % u = GraphInput(desc) where desc is the input description
    %
    % Definable properties (with class) include:
    % - Description (string)
    % - Bounds (Limits)
