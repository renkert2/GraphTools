classdef extrinsicProp_Types
    % extrinsicProp_Types is an enumeration class that stores information 
    % pertaining to the different types of extrinsicProps, i.e. mass and 
    % price.  Each type is associated with a combination function (usually
    % @sum), and a numeric id that allows us to define a sort method for the 
    % class.  
    % A class must have a sort method to call unique() on the class
