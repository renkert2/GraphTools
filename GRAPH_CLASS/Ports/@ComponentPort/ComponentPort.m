classdef ComponentPort < handle
    % The ComponentPort class defines external connections for a component
    % in the Graph Modeling Toolbox. The external connections are
    % associated with an edge of vertex (see PortTypes) of a Graph object.
    % Instatiate an empty object, use the input parser, or
    % P = ComponentPort(desc) defines port P with Description desc or
    % P = ComponentPort(elmt) defines port P with Element elmt
    % Definable properties (with class) include:
    % - Description (string)
    % - Element (GraphEdge or GraphVertex)
